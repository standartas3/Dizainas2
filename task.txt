1. Build a website as close as possible to the original copy

// HTML and CSS
2.   font-family: "Lato", serif;
3.   max-width: 960px; (for conatiner class)
4. Colors:
     #00aca8
     #674ea0
     #FFF
     #000
5. Media queries:
    ~ 776px and
    ~ 550px
p.s but you can set your own media queries depending on the elements' width and etc.


// JavaScript
6. button `Dropdown` should show 3 options
7. button `Connect with us` should scroll down to the contact form
8. When a user scrolls down more than 60px (>60px), in the right bottom corner
icon up `^` should appear - which will scroll top on click

 //Mobile
 9. at ~776px `Dropdown` button disapears and we show `nav-burger`
 10. When user clicks on `nav-burger` mobile menu should appear from top to bottom
 and cover all page (see working example)
11. In the mobile menu we add additional button `X` that will close the mobile menu


...Good luck! :)

Hints:

1. Don't forget to include in HTML:
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
2. Don't forget to link your HTML to style.css and js.js
3. Don't forget that you can check all sizes of every element in inspect window,
also colors and other stuff!
4. Icons: nav burger, envolope, up '^' can be found on fontawesome.com or you can use
your own resources
